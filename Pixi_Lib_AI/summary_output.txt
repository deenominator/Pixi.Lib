This document details a research project aimed at developing a novel exoplanet detection pipeline using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).  The project leverages existing exoplanet detection methods and datasets, primarily focusing on data from the Kepler mission.

**Existing Exoplanet Detection Methods:** The document reviews three established exoplanet detection techniques:

1. **Transit Method:** Detects periodic dips in a star's brightness caused by a planet passing in front of it.  This method is susceptible to false positives from binary stars or stellar variability.
2. **Radial Velocity Method:** Measures the wobble of a star caused by the gravitational pull of orbiting planets, detectable through Doppler shifts in the star's light.
3. **Gravitational Microlensing:** Observes the brightening of a star's light as a planet gravitationally lenses the light from a background star.

**Existing Datasets and Pipelines:** The project examines two previously published pipelines:

1. **A Deep Learning Approach:** This pipeline uses Kepler data, cleaning and pre-processing it (removing outliers, filling gaps), generating synthetic data to augment the real data, and performing 1D and 2D phase folding to create image inputs for a CNN.  2D phase folding, particularly, is highlighted for its ability to detect planets even with slightly inaccurate period estimations.  The Box Least Squares (BLS) algorithm is employed to estimate the transit period.
2. **AstroNet:** This pipeline utilizes Threshold Crossing Events (TCEs) from Kepler data.  It pre-processes the light curves (outlier removal, flattening), creates both global and local views of the phase-folded data, and employs ensemble modeling with two CNNs to improve classification accuracy.


**Proposed Pipeline:** The core of the project proposes a new pipeline integrating BLS, 2D phase folding, and CNNs.  Several strategies are explored:

* **Initial Strategy (Multi-Period):** Uses BLS to find the top 10 periods, performs 2D phase folding for each, and uses two CNNsâ€”one for the local view (high-resolution image of a single transit) and one for the 2D phase-folded image.  Ensemble modeling combines the predictions.
* **Improved Strategy (Single-Period, Iterative):**  Uses BLS iteratively. It finds the strongest signal, masks it, and repeats to detect multiple planets.  This approach employs a "Shape Expert" CNN for 1D averaged views and a "Consistency Expert" CNN for the 2D image, combining their outputs for a final confidence score.
* **Top-Down Approach:** Uses a 1D CNN to predict the number of planets, followed by BLS to find those periods and a 2D CNN for vetting. This approach is deemed less promising due to difficulties in detecting small dips in long light curves without phase folding.

**Challenges and Experiments:** The project encounters several challenges:

* **BLS Limitations:**  BLS is slow and its output isn't always a perfect indicator of a planet; it can be affected by stellar noise and other phenomena.
* **Dataset Imbalance:**  Initial experiments with a pre-processed Kaggle dataset highlight the problem of class imbalance (far more non-exoplanets than exoplanets), leading to poor performance despite high accuracy metrics.
* **Data Preprocessing:** The substantial Kepler dataset requires extensive preprocessing (stitching light curves, outlier removal, normalization, flattening using Savitzky-Golay filtering).  The Google Colab environment causes interruptions, hindering progress.
* **Model Selection and Fine-tuning:** Experiments with pre-trained models (VGG16, VGG19, ResNet, Inception, Xception, EfficientNet) on 2D phase-folded images face challenges due to the grayscale nature of the images (pre-trained models are typically trained on RGB images) and difficulties in balancing the class distribution.  Attempts at fine-tuning pre-trained models on the 2D images, including undersampling, yield unsatisfactory results.
* **Synthetic Data Generation:**  The project generates a synthetic dataset to address class imbalance using parameters from a previous paper.  The generated curves have to be carefully checked as the procedure might sometimes produce unwanted artifacts.


**Progress and Next Steps:**  The project downloads the Kepler data from NASA's archive, pre-processes it, and creates 1D and 2D phase-folded images.  Experiments with Xception show moderate accuracy (around 70%).  Future work includes: creating a custom CNN architecture incorporating both 2D phase-folded and local views, improving the synthetic data generation process, experimenting with other pre-trained models and transformers, potentially adding variation to the 2D phase folding, and addressing the computational limitations by using computing resources with accelerators.
